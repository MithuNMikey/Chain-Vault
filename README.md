Blockchain Drive is a decentralized platform that revolutionizes digital asset management by combining the power of Ethereum blockchain and IPFS for secure image storage and controlled sharing. Utilizing Solidity smart contracts, the system records image metadata—specifically IPFS hashes—to ensure immutable proof of ownership and manage granular access permissions. The architecture minimizes on-chain data usage while leveraging IPFS's distributed network for tamper-proof storage, ensuring that images remain censorship-resistant and secure. A modern front-end built with React.js and optimized by Vite provides a responsive and user-friendly interface, integrating seamlessly with Metamask for secure Ethereum transactions. Overall, Blockchain Drive offers a scalable and transparent alternative to traditional cloud storage, empowering users with complete control over their digital assets in a trustless environment.
